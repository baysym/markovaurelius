# markovaurelius

Python-based Markov chain recreations of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations using Jeremy Singer-Vines's [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).

Users can generate a random 'poem' without human intervention, or can generate a random 'poem' and regenerate individual lines as they see fit.
